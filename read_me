    0: ICMP Echo Request Message
    1: TCP SYN packet to port 80
    2: UDP packet to port 53


How to run the program ?

Program is a command-line interface and can be run on terminal by running the following command: 

./secret_sender <ip_address> <interface> <type> <message>


e.g. : ./secret_sender 192.168.5.2 eth0 1 SSisFUN
